## What Makes a Great eCommerce Website Design?

From the examples above, it becomes clear that [designing a website](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-design-a-website) for eCommerce isn’t only about aesthetics – it is also about the overall UX.

This section will cover the top six eCommerce features every business owner needs to consider when creating a new online store or revamping their existing website.

### 1\. Clear Online Store Navigation

Here are some key elements of [user-friendly online store](https://dokan.co/wordpress/) navigation:

- **Self-explanatory menu items.** Use familiar labels for your menus like **Home**, **Product**, **Blog**, and **Contact** to make navigation intuitive. If you have many categories, consider using a mega menu like **Crate & Barrel** to let shoppers see different options at a glance.

- **Easy-to-find search bar.** [The best placement for a search bar](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/search-bar-design) is either at the top-right or top-center of a web page. For better ease of use, add autocomplete suggestions like **Zenni**.
- **Informative footer.** A footer can be helpful for visitors trying to navigate through essential information like shipping, return, and refund policies.
- **Comprehensive filters.** Improve your product findability using price, color, and sort-by filters.
- **Breadcrumbs.** These act as navigational aids to inform visitors where they are on the site. It also helps [Google understand your site structure](https://yoast.com/breadcrumbs-seo/) better.

### 2\. Seamless Shopping Cart and Checkout Process

A complex checkout procedure is one of the primary [reasons for cart abandonment](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate). Therefore, simplifying the process is vital to boosting sales and the overall UX.

For optimal performance, place the shopping cart icon in the upper-right corner and display the number of items in the cart to help visitors keep track of their potential purchases.

If you visit **Zenni**, for instance, the shopping cart icon is gray when the cart is empty but turns turquoise and displays the number of items once customers add products. You can also use **Grainne Morton** ’s detailed pop-up shopping cart as a reference.

Consider also adding a progress bar on the checkout page like **Frans Hals Museum** if you have a multi-page payment completion process. Alternatively, use a single checkout page like **Nike** to simplify the shopping experience.

### 3\. Consistent Online Business Branding

Brand consistency means ensuring that your brand values, identity, and messaging are uniform across all channels. Statistics show that people tend to remember a brand after [five to seven impressions](https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/branding-statistics/), so maintaining cohesive messaging can help boost brand awareness.

Here are some essentials to [building a successful brand](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-brand):

- Have clear business goals and values.
- Create a memorable brand name and custom domain.
- Maintain the brand’s voice and tone.
- Present consistent visual elements, including logos and color palettes.

To start branding your online business, specify your target audience during the initial eCommerce website development stages.

For example,[**Allbirds** ’ potential segments](https://www.projectdigital.org/segmenting-allbirds-audience/) include millennials and Gen Z who enjoy the outdoors. This helps the company position itself as an environmentally friendly brand focusing on sustainability.

Another useful tip is to research your competition. To have a strong online presence, develop a unique brand strategy compared to other small businesses in your industry. For example, **Mack & Pouya** uses bright colors on its online store while most of its competitors integrate minimalist styles.

### 4\. Readable and Engaging Content

Most of the time, visitors simply scan the site to look for crucial information. That said, making scannable content is important for a good eCommerce experience.

Break up the website content into an easy-to-scan format by:

- Keeping the paragraphs and sentences short.
- Highlighting important information with bold fonts.
- Integrating bullet lists to avoid large blocks of text.
- Using images in your content.

Helpful tools like **Readable** and **Grammarly** can check the length of your sentences and language style to ensure readability.

Additionally, consider using interactive content – take the quizzes on **Vitra** ’s online store and 360-degree experience on **Heveya** ’s eCommerce website as examples. This type of content can [enhance conversions to 40-50%](https://www.singlegrain.com/blog-posts/content-marketing/7-types-of-interactive-content-why-and-how-to-use-them/) and social shares by 28%.

### 5\. Mobile-First Online Shopping

[Almost 80% of customers](https://techjury.net/blog/mcommerce-statistics/) have made a purchase online using their mobile devices, and [Google also prioritizes mobile-friendly sites](https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-first-indexing) on its search engine results pages (SERPs).

So, not only is having a [mobile-friendly website](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/mobile-friendly-website) crucial to improve your store’s UX, but it is also essential to boost the site’s SEO.

The first step to delivering a smooth [mobile commerce](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/mobile-commerce) experience is to use a responsive template or theme on any eCommerce platform you use. Mobile-friendly [eCommerce website templates](https://www.hostinger.com/templates/ecommerce) will adjust to any device, so you won’t have to worry about creating a separate site for mobile users.

Before selecting a design template, check the theme description to see if it has a demo page. Copy the page’s link and paste it on **Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test** to determine its responsiveness.

![Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test's interface when the page is mobile-friendly, containing the test results and details like the crawled date and additional resources.](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/Googles-Mobile-Friendly-Test_s-interface-when-the-page-is-mobile-friendly-containing-the-test-results-and-details-like-the-crawled-date-and-additional-resources..png)

Additionally, make sure all website elements like CTA buttons, forms, and navigation menus are touchscreen-friendly by adjusting the sizing, spacing, and shapes.

### 6\. Transparency and Security

Without proper [eCommerce security](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ecommerce-security), hackers can divert payments and steal credit card details from online stores. This can contribute to significant losses in revenue and reputation as [over 40% of shoppers](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumers-like-the-benefits-of-online-shopping-despite-the-security-risks/) will stop buying from an online store if it experiences a data breach.

Large enterprises and small businesses alike should ensure to:

- [Purchase an SSL certificate](https://www.hostinger.com/free-ssl-certificate) on the website.
- Provide a secure payment gateway system.
- Be transparent about customer data collection.

Check the data privacy laws applicable to your target audience’s region. For example, the [European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/complete-wordpress-gdpr-guide/) directly impacts data collection for businesses targeting customers in the EU.

**uMake** is a great example of an eCommerce business displaying data collection transparency. It provides links within the website footer explaining the privacy policy and terms of use. The site also has detailed and scannable information about how the company keeps users’ personal information safe.
