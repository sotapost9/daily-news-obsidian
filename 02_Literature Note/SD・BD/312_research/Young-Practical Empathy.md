## Highlights

>Curiosity about people is key to the empathetic mindset. ^ref-17711

---
>People who have received constant positive feedback for speaking about themselves might have a hard time learning to be curious about other people. In addition, people who are used to solving other people’s problems (like a doctor) will have a difficult time turning off their deductive thought process in order to absorb more detail through listening. ^ref-40311

---
>How should I train to increase my empathy skills? Practice listening to people every chance you get. Practice shutting down your inner voice so that you can hear more clearly and recognize when you need to ask more to really understand something. ^ref-5511
